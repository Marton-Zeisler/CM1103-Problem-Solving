# CM1103-Problem-Solving
Learning about mathematical theories to model problems and practicing programming skills to implement efficient solutions.


## Description
This module will provide students with the fundamental programming and problem solving skills necessary to continue study in Computer Science. The delivery of the module will be case study based, motivated by a study of a number of classical and topical real-world problems. Through these, the module will introduce the mathematical theory necessary to model problems and the programming skills necessary to implement efficient solutions.
